## Overview

This is a website created for Eric. It is an inferno-postgres-express-node stack, using an implementation of Brain-Freeze, a redux like library that gives the developer more control over the state of the application. The purpose of this project is to produce a fast, and responsive application that can scale and work on any device as necessary.
