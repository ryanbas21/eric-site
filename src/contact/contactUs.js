        A few of the most common questions I get are below:
    </p>
    <h3>F.A.Q</h3>
    <p><h5>When is the next newsletter coming out?</h5></p>

    <p>The newsletter is always sent out the first Monday of the month.
       If a holiday lands on a Monday, the newsletter will be sent out Tuesday morning.
        The newsletter should hit your inbox at 6am.
        As a newsletter provider I cannot give personalized investment advice.
         I do not know your personal situation, and will not make individual recommendations.

<p>Thanks,</p>
